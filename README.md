Personal Memory OS is a simple assistant built with Python and Streamlit that lets you upload PDF, TXT, or DOCX files, extract their text, and store that text into a memory file you can search later. In this first part of the build, I focused on file uploading, text extraction using PyMuPDF, python-docx, and chardet, and saving the cleaned text into a structured memory.json file. I also added a basic keyword search feature to help users look through their saved content. The project is organized into separate Python modules for reading files, managing memory, and handling search. The Streamlit interface provides a clean way to interact with the app in a browser.  This part sets up the foundation for future stages like text chunking, semantic embeddings, GPT-powered answers, and a full local memory assistant.
